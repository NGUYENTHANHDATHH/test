CAU1:
The multiplicity between Person and Beverage indicates how many beverages a person can have and how many people can have the same beverage.
For example, if the multiplicity is Person * — * Beverage, it means a person can drink many beverages, and a beverage can be consumed by many persons.
CAU2:
The relationship between Beverage, Tea, and Coffee is an inheritance (generalization) relationship.
Beverage is the superclass, and Tea and Coffee are subclasses.
This means Tea and Coffee inherit the common attributes and methods of Beverage,
while they can also have their own specific features.

CAU5:
he Mandatory Access Control (MAC) model should be used by organizations researching high-tech space technologies.
In MAC, access permissions are centrally controlled and based on security classifications assigned to both users and data.
Users cannot modify access rights on their own, ensuring strict confidentiality, integrity, and protection of highly sensitive information — which is essential for aerospace and defense research environments.
CAU6:
The Discretionary Access Control (DAC) model is suitable for organizations that prioritize work efficiency over security and frequently change their system or authorization structure.
In DAC, data owners control access permissions, allowing quick adjustments to user rights.
It offers high flexibility and ease of management, making it ideal for dynamic organizations, though it provides weaker security compared to MAC.

Communication flows step by step — from top to bottom or bottom to top.

👤 Member’s Viewpoint:

Members communicate only with their immediate superior or subordinate.

Information speed is slow — it must pass through every level.

Risk of distortion increases as messages move through intermediaries.

Decision-making is centralized at the top (A), and lower members (E) have little influence.

Efficient for hierarchical control but poor for creativity or feedback.

A is the central hub connected directly to B, C, D, and E.
Others communicate only through A.

👤 Member’s Viewpoint:

Centralized communication: All messages go through the leader (A).

A receives and distributes all information — very high control and coordination.

Other members (B–E) are dependent on A and have limited interaction with each other.

Efficient for simple or routine tasks where quick decisions are needed.

However, members feel isolated, and A may be overloaded with information.
All members (A, B, C, D, E) are directly connected to one another.

👤 Member’s Viewpoint:

Every member can communicate freely and equally with everyone else.

High participation, satisfaction, and creativity.

Fast feedback and collaborative problem-solving.
CAU11:
The current backup policy of the customer management system has several problems:

Inadequate Backup Frequency: Backups are performed irregularly, risking data loss when recent updates are not captured.

Improper Backup Storage: Backup data is stored on the same server as the live system, making both vulnerable to hardware or disaster failures.

Lack of Verification and Recovery Testing: Backups are not tested for integrity or restorability, so recovery may fail when needed.
These issues make the system unreliable in case of data loss. The company should implement regular automated backups, off-site storage, and periodic recovery testing to ensure data safety and business continuity.

CAU12:
Backup Type	Purpose	Frequency	Storage Duration
Full (Total) Backup	Creates a complete copy of the database for baseline recovery	Once per week (e.g., Sunday 2:00 AM)	Keep 4–6 weeks
Differential Backup	Backs up only data changed since the last full backup	Daily (e.g., Mon–Sat 2:00 AM)	Keep 2–3 weeks
Archive Log Backup	Captures all transaction logs to restore data to any point in time	Every 5–15 minutes	Keep 7–30 days

Selected Architecture Pattern: MVC (Model–View–Controller) Pattern

The MVC Pattern is selected for Company L’s next-generation system because it clearly separates user interface (View), business logic (Controller), and data processing (Model).
This separation minimizes unnecessary interactions among layers, improves reusability, and allows functional disassembly and centralized management, all of which align perfectly with the given architecture requirements.

2. Process Flow Explanation
Overall Structure

Model – Manages business data and logic. Communicates with databases through repositories or data access layers.

View – Displays information to the user and sends user inputs to the Controller.

Controller – Acts as the coordinator. It receives user requests, invokes the proper business logic from the Model, and selects a View for the response.
